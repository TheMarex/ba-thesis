# Push recovery

As we saw in the chapter about Stabilizers, not all disturbences can be compensated.
If the disturbence reaches a certain severity, the trajectory can not be executed as planed without falling.
Thus the trajectory needs to be changed radically to avoid falling.
There is little hope to recover from continous heavy disturbences, as any attempt to recover
will be defeated. Thus we focus on short but severe disturbences, pushes.

The most prominent methode to recover from pushes is the Capture Point. The idea is to find
a point, that will guarantee that the CoM comes to a rest, if the support foot is instantanously placed there.

## Capture Point

Pratt \todo{Add citation} derives the Capture Point for multiple models based on the 3D-LIPM.
