# Introduction

Nearly one hundret years of Sci-Fiction have estabilished the firm image
of a mechanical humanoid servant with super humand capabilities, with the term
*Robot*.
Today we live in a world where large parts of our production circles are already
governed by robots. Yet, widespread adoption of humanoid robots is still nowhere in evidence.
One core problem of humanoid robots is their inherent complexity.
Vison, cognition, manipulation and locomotion all need to be combined in one mechanism.
While every of these problems is under active research, one has been especially resilient: Locomotion.
Some robots, e.g. the \name{Armar III} robots, solve it by replacing the legs
with a stable base on wheels. While this yields convinient research platform,
the navigation in human environments is not as natural as for full humanoid robots.

Over the last two decades a lot of progress has been made in humanoid walking.
Every one is familiar with the famous ASIMO robot developed by Honda or the HRP
robots developed by AIST which demostrate stable walking.
More recently ATLAS by Boston Dynamics shows great stability even under disturbances.
Sadly most of these platforms are closed and it is not known exactly which models
are used in each robot to derive stable walking.


1. Motivation why walking is important. (drop a few names of humanoid bipedals)
2. Approaches to make robots walk: Synthetic <-> Motion Capture
3. Walking in humans:
	- Gait phases
	- CoM movement \todo{I mentioned that somewhere else, move it here.}
4. Static stability vs. dynamic stability
5. Overview of models for dynamic stability: Details later
6. Overview of the software created
