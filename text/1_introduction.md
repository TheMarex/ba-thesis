# Introduction
motivation,  and a bit of overview of humanoid walking.  I recommend to leave it for later, start with the sections that you feel its easier to write (usually, the ones that have more content).

- motivation:
	- navigating in human environments
- walking in humans:
	- CoM movement, gait phases, differences to what we do here
- static vs. dynamic walking
- overview of models used for dynamic walking
